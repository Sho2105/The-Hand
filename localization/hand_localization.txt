@firearm_HAND_AR_name=Thumb's M4  
@firearm_HAND_AR_desc=Hey Mom, I’m here. First day with the squad. They’re good people. Mason—our lead—keeps saying we’re a family, all twenty-one of us. He’s rough, but you can tell he cares. Told me not to die too fast, says it’d make him look bad. I think I’ll be okay. I’ll write again soon. Love you.

@firearm_HAND_ARsup_desc=Lemme guess, next you’ll tell me to bring rubber bullets too?  

@firearm_HAND_SMG_name=Index's MP5A  
@firearm_HAND_SMG_desc=I picked up something for you today. Handmade, stitched with gold thread—I swear, it has your name written all over it. Reminds me of home. Thought about keeping it for myself, but I figured you’d call me selfish. I’ll send it with my next letter. Just a little longer, love. Just a little longer, and I’ll be back.

@firearm_HAND_LMG_name=Middle's M249SPW  
@firearm_HAND_LMG_desc=Got a good bunch of kids this time. Fresh, green, all wide-eyed like they just stepped outta a storybook. You should see ‘em at the campfire—telling dumb jokes, burning their rations like it’s gourmet cooking. One even tried to roast a whole can without opening it first. Nearly lost his eyebrows. They remind me why I’m still here. Someone’s gotta keep ‘em steady, y’know? Make sure they got a shot at seeing home again.

@firearm_HAND_SG_desc=Hope you’re keeping your room clean. If I come home to a mess, you’re running laps. Squad’s good. New guy won’t stop clicking his damn pen—drives me nuts. But he’s sharp. We drilled today, everything lined up perfect. Clean. Precise. Almost like when we stacked Dad’s firewood just right. I miss that. Miss you too. Stay out of trouble, alright?

@firearm_HAND_DMR_name=Pinky's MK20  
@firearm_HAND_DMR_desc=Hey Dad… Just two more months, and I’ll have enough. The doctor says we can still fix this, but we can’t wait much longer. I know you don’t like hospitals, but this time, you have to go. No more excuses. Noa says she’ll drag you there herself if she has to. She wants to meet you, by the way. Says she needs to see the man who raised me. I think she just wants to make sure I’m real. She still doesn’t believe I used to be even quieter.
