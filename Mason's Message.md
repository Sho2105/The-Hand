## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  

Sir, it’s done. **NULL Task Force is eliminated.**  

Unfortunately, not completely.  

Five operatives have somehow been resurrected. I don't know how it happened, but I know for sure that the anomalies from that operation did something to them.  

I don’t know **what the fuck they are** now, but they sure as hell aren’t human anymore.  
And they’re hunting me, craving their bloody revenge.  

SP-84-C was **confirmed dead**. I saw him **fucking bleed out**.  

But now? He moves between black sites **without records, without orders, without clearance**—as if nothing had ever happened.  

And he’s not alone.  
There are **four more just like him.**  

**I need immediate action. NOW.**

We, NULL Task Force, were your weapon.  
But now? It’s **not under your control anymore.**

## CONTINGENCY PLAN  

Sir, they **will not stop.**  

I require **immediate extraction and asset protection.**  

I **betrayed my own brothers for you.**  
If extraction is not possible, then **I need them eliminated.**  

And the worst part?  
I think they know.  

I fear they will **voluntarily align with the Insurgency.**  
And if they do, then we won’t just have a problem.  

We’ll have **the biggest fucking disaster we’ve ever faced.**  

We **can’t** let that happen.  

If I go dark, **you will never gain the encryption key.**  

It’s time for you to reap the "benefits" of your commitment to staying in a clean suit.  

**Good luck.**  

**- Mason Carter**
