<Mod title="The Hand" gameVersion="108" author="Sho" description="[h1] 🖐️ ZA HANDO!!! [/h1]  
This mod started as a small project between me and my friend, inspired by the one-man-army style of Agent 47… but yeah, that got boring real fast. So instead, I built this with its own world-building and lore.    
[hr]  
[h2]💀 What’s in the mod so far?[/h2]  
• The Hand, a squad of 5 each with unique (OP af) gears.
• Custom doctrine tree and deployment GUI
• Placeholder N.T.F soldiers for future expansion 
• Mostly vanilla assets (because I suck at making art 😭 finding help tho)  
[hr]  
[h2]📌 Roadmap[/h2]  
[h3]Near Future (whenever uni gives me a break):[/h3]  
• Expand The Hand with more unique gear, and tactical options  
• Start giving N.T.F their own unique weapons and gears
[h3]Further down the line:[/h3]  
• Fully develop N.T.F. with unique loadouts and balancing 
• Expand lore beyond just weapon descriptions  
• Custom mission pack  
• My own models and textures :D

[h2]⚡ About The Mod ⚡[/h2]  
The mod has 2 branches:  
[b]The Hand[/b] – A highly specialized, OP squad with unique weapons, armor, and gear. They’re &quot;Anomalies,&quot; meaning they’ll have exclusive abilities and loadouts that no other units can use.  
[b]Null Task Force (N.T.F)[/b] – A tactical, balanced force meant to provide a more grounded experience. While they’ll still get some unique gear, they’ll also have vanilla weapons and equipment for those who prefer a more traditional playstyle.
