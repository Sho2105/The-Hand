Current stoled assets:Blank Portraits, Black Fatigue uniform textures, and 2 airstrike bombs codes, medpack codes.
Will add in: custom portraits, custom textures(lowpriority), and 2 models for the airstrikes and medpack, and the waypoint ui too..
Checklist: portraits, custom right HAND squad logo

  Todo:Custom GUI deploy and doctrines
  AFAIK, doctrines need 3 files, doctrines and unit nodes in Units folder, and a GUI

A faceless female soldier in a dark, moody battlefield setting. She wears a soft-black vest with pouches and straps, and her white hair is tied up in a loose bun. Her face is fully obscured by pitch black shadow, distortion, and glitchy effects, making her features unrecognizable. The atmosphere is gritty and cinematic, with a smoky background adding depth. The lighting is dramatic. The art style is painterly. Chest-up.
A dark, glitchy, and grim battlefield environment covered in countless injured and lifeless corpses. The setting is dystopian and eerie, with heavy fog and a bloodstained landscape. The background is shadowy, with faint, ominous structures or ruins barely visible through the haze. There are no soldiers or creatures in this image‚Äîonly the abandoned, horrific battlefield. The atmosphere is unsettling, with distortion and glitch effects enhancing the nightmare-like feel. The image is heavily blurred and designed for a parallax effect. This is the background layer. The aspect ratio is 3:2 landscape.

tear-gas grenade, decoy grenade, rpgs, maybe some six barrels grenade launchers?
A shield, yes, a shield
Maybe a gas grenade and a gas mask?

Shit, it is possible for a flamethrower, check the ngf asset mod, also possible to spawn cover(movement block entities) out, check usaf, it is not possible to slow enemies down, but we can "pin" them down by supression param

A device that intervally stun enemies in a big radius?
A grenade that pushes enemies away far (currently unable to push shits, maybe just stunlock hold them in place is enough i guess)
Air Support (USAF MOD, we don't such good sounds though...but maybe we can focus on the visual and explosion part, and borrow some assets online)
Flare gun (USAF MOD, used for light at night, or just some glowsticks is fine too)
A super strong gun with limited bullet (best if it can dig wall, maybe both a sniper and a rpg version)
2 tiers medkit.
A god damn megaphone to evacuate a whole zone of civilian (and attract enemies attention, of course)
Some drones, maybe a suicide drone, and an intel gatherer drone, annnnd maybe a drone that can shoot?

Where possible, applies spawn entities of a black flame to represent unique material used to fight anomallies

I‚Äôve analyzed your request to create a streamlined list of firearm and ammo categories for a tactical game, ensuring every type serves a unique purpose without bloating the list with redundancy. The goal is to cover all tactical scenarios‚Äîlike long-range sniping, close-quarters combat, suppression, breaching, and anti-materiel‚Äîwhile avoiding weapons or ammo that overlap in function. I‚Äôve drawn from real-world weaponry and their distinct roles, keeping heavy shields as requested but excluding melee options. Here‚Äôs the concise, comprehensive list:
I'm planning on giving every Hand members their own unique models haha  and retexture the whole NTF squad (This should be easier)
So imma try
To finish their equipment first
Then i will finish the Hand's equipments
Thennnnn i will come to add unique model and textures and shit
And
If i find some good sound packages online
Imma add gun sounds
explosion sounds
Straw hat, Scarf, Backpack
Hostage blind fold, and gas masks, also redraw textures
Redo Ring's breacher into a bigger explosion that does NOT kill, turn Middle's into a nuke
