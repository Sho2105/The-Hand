- mass bake export all textures to png.
- mass convert them to dds
- mass resize-attach helpers-collision box
- mass export to khm
- also generate UI for them with ComfyUI
- create the flamethrower model or just use the grenade launcher-whatever-then generate the UI using online image (update-already got a nice flamethrower model)
- same with the shield
- start working on the code,  make the guns appear in game as 6 categories, so does the shield
- rework The Hand's attacktypes, and their gears
- some quick balance to gun stats
- in general, make weapon models works, then code it, then make the UI, balance can wait, prioritize functional shits first
- finally works on the gears, then i guess we can release the update...this is gonna be a long shit
- afer 3 days of continously fucking with 3dsmax and rigging, weighting, i came to a conclusion that its a waste of time to fuck with it again, unless i have more time in the future, for now, fuck it.
- I decided to reuse base game's guns, only add unique guns for the Hand branch (for now)
- Tonigh's objectives:Explosion sounds, complete UI pack and 5 guns(okay i think i found sounds for everything tbh, i need to prepare every assets needed)
- update:Basic workflow is : bake textures first, then work on the model, rid of any unnecessary parts, decimate once,  then import helpers from base game's models, tweak, remember to not select all when apply transform
- Work on unique attachments later
- accidently worked on the particle system tonight(04/11/2025) looks nice though, muzzle flashes not done yet
- what next? complete the guns, then start working on unique gears, before adding guns from the base game  (just copy paste and rename for now), then add a complete gun sound lib, then apply the lib to NTF's guns. Maybe custom trails too
- Holy shit the base game gun's textures is so low, 128x128
- to do next: Normal tier helmet and hightier helmet model (done a low tier one...next should be a med one and high one)
- holy fucking hell, okay the low tier one works fine i guess...the scifi one is usable but, cant have a built in NVG which just ruin its whole mood...
- okay, fuck it, next thing we're gonna do is to properly make every items in the game, no more models needed(maybe will come back later, but for now the rattan is iconic enough)
--- 
- rework doctrine tree, create new upgradable
- redraw uniform, vest, helmets textures
- redraw rank icons
---
- add new sounds
- add custom enemies (which include custom behavior, models, textures, sounds)
- add custom campaign (me thinking about a full blown war missionpacks)
- finally, focus on the story and world building and polish everything
- along the way, always remember to come back and polish sounds and visual fx, as your 3d skill is ass
