UI, bots, placeholder descriptions
--- 
- rework doctrine tree, create new upgradable
- redraw uniform, vest, helmets textures
- redraw rank icons

- add new sounds
- add custom enemies (which include custom behavior, models, textures, sounds)
- add custom campaign (me thinking about a full blown war missionpacks)
- finally, focus on the story and world building and polish everything
- along the way, always remember to come back and polish sounds and visual fx, as your 3d skill is ass
